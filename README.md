Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Overview
This repository contains the implementation of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), a crucial first step in any data science or machine learning project. EDA helps in understanding the dataset by visualizing the structure, patterns, missing values, outliers, and correlations between features, allowing us to clean and preprocess the data effectively before model building.

🔍 Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Includes techniques for handling missing values, removing duplicates, and detecting outliers.
Univariate Analysis: Understanding each feature's distribution and central tendency.
Bivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between features using visualizations.
Data Visualization: Creating various plots like histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps to understand the data better.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to improve the quality of the data for machine learning models.
📂 Files Included
FITBIT data.csv – A CSV file.
EDA_Code.ipynb – Python code for performing EDA using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
🛠 Technologies Used
Python – Programming language for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib – Basic plotting and visualizations.
Seaborn – Advanced data visualization.
